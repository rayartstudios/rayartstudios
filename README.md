# 👨‍💻 Ryan

### Code. Build. Repeat.

I'm Ryan — a developer who doesn't chase trends. I learn fast, ship faster, and break things just to rebuild them better. Currently diving deep into:

- 🧠 **AI/ML + Game Dev + IoT**
- 🛠 Unreal Engine Geek
- 🧩 Building weird systems, cursed experiments, and cool tools
- ⚙️ Terminal enjoyer, Linux learner, and OS tinkerer
- 🔥 Trying not to rewrite my entire project at 2AM every night

---
**FOUNDER OF - WatchCat Co.**
---
### 🚧 What I’m working on
- indie games, Custom OS and late-night code marathons.
- Learning how to mix physics and code like it’s alchemy.
- Slowly turning caffeine and chaos into stable builds (sometimes).

---

### 🛠 Languages & Tools
`Python` | `C` | `C++` | `JavaScript` | `HTML/CSS` | `Linux` | `Godot` | `Unity (C#)` | `Unreal Engine (Blueprints)` | `Arduino` | `Raspberry Pi` | `Git`

> I’m not here to make perfect code. I’m here to make things that work — and learn from the stuff that doesn’t.

### 📂 Repos Worth a Peek
I don’t hide my mess. Feel free to dig through:
- 💀 Experimental AI stuff
- 🧟 Retro-inspired horror games
- 📦 Tiny utils I made at 3AM and forgot about

---

### 📡 Ping me if you:
- Wanna collab on games or weird physics ideas
- Need someone who isn’t afraid to refactor everything without crying
- Just feel like talking code, chaos, or cats (Bingus supremacy)

---

### 💬 Last Words
I’m not here for followers or fame. I’m here because building things with code is the only time my brain shuts up.

**Feel free to fork, star, or just lurk. Either way, welcome to the mess.**
